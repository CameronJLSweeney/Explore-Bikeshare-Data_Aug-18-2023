Explore Bikeshare Data with R
## Introduction:
This project explores data from a bicycle-sharing system provider called Motivate that analyzes how users across three cities use the biclcye-sharing system. There are three questions being asked:
  1) What is the most common day of the week?
  2) What is the most common trip from start to end?
  3) What is the total trip duration for users in different cities?


## Installation Instructions:
This project was completed in a Jupyter notebook and uses the R language.
Three csv files were used in this project:
  -chicago.csv
  -new_york_city.csv
  -washington.csv

The original data files were much larger and messier and were not downloaded for this project. This project uses the updated data wrangled by the Udacity team.
  ## Known Issues:
  NA
